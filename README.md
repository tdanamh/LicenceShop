Licence project

The application is a WEB application which uses the latest technologies in the field of information technology in order to offer a simple and elegant content based on listing properties around the world for renting. The application allows users to view and rent properties, to access the profile page and all information related to previous rentings. For the whole project I used the JavaScript programming language. For the back-end side I used a Node.js framework called Express.js and for the front-end side I used a JavaScript framework called Angular.js. For data storage I used a NoSQL database called MongoDB.
