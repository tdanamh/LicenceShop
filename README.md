Licence project

For the bachelor’s thesis I created a software application in order to offer users a useful simple and pleasant experience for renting properties.
The main objective of the application is to minimise the time spent when choosing a holiday destination.

Time is an important factor in daily activities, so each person wishes to spend as little time as possible in any activity in order to have as much time left to relax. Moreover the application aims to build an unforgettable user experience, based on simplicity because simplicity always offers pleasant experiences to which users return with pleasure.

The objectives presented above express clearly and concisely the relevance of an application for choosing the desired holiday destination.

When planning a vacation we do not want to go to a travel agency and lose a lot of time, but we want to be able to search for the desired destination easily, from any type of device, in the shortest possible time and in the simplest possible way, easy for everyone to understand regardless of age.

The application is a WEB application which uses the latest technologies in the field of information technology in order to offer a simple and elegant content based on listing properties around the world for renting. The application allows users to view and rent properties, to access the profile page and all information related to previous rentings. For the whole project I used the JavaScript programming language. For the back-end side I used a Node.js framework called Express.js and for the front-end side I used a JavaScript framework called Angular.js. For data storage I used a NoSQL database called MongoDB.

Although there are already WEB applications for booking properties, I believe that the small number of these applications is related to their complexity which decreases the number of users. This application’s advantage is simplicity, which is offered both by the easy-to-use user interface and by the rental process itself.
